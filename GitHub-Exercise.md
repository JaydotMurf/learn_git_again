# GitHub Exercise

## Part I

> Letâ€™s start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

---

1. Create a local repository and add and commit some files
2. Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote
3. Create a local branch and add and commit some files
4. Push that local branch to GitHub to create a remote branch

---

`git init`
`git add .`
`git commit -m "message about the commit"`
`git remote add origin URL`
`git push origin main`
